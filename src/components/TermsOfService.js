EstateSync is an estate management solution for users to store, organize, and share information pertaining to their, or another party's, estate. Once an account in EstateSync is created, a user can upload information pertaining to specific accounts and assets (brokerage accounts, bank accounts, retirement accounts, insurance, real estate, debts, liabilities, loans, and other assets) as well as documents that are pertinent to their estate or assets. The account information contains basic information as well as the option for freeform notes. This user’s "portal” can be shared by the user with trusted contacts such as family members, professional financial, legal, or tax counsel, or other contacts. The user may elect whether these contacts have permissions to edit the content contained in the user's portal, or if they simply have “view-only” access.
              <br/>(b) Any modifications and new features added to the Service are also subject to this Agreement.
              <br/>(c) EstateSync reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or any feature or functionality thereof at any time without notice to you. All right, title, and interest in and to our Service and its components (including all intellectual property rights) will remain with and belong exclusively to, EstateSync.

            <li>
              <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
              <br/>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION CONTAINS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION ALSO CONTAINS AN AGREEMENT THAT YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
              <br/>You and EstateSync agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and EstateSync (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of EstateSync) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of EstateSync or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution Section.
              <br/>(a) <b>Applicable Law.</b> You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and EstateSync, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.
              <br/>(b) <b>Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and EstateSync, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and EstateSync are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. If you reside in the U.S., the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
              <br/>(c) <b>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</b> YOU AND ESTATESYNC AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ESTATESYNC AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
              <br/>(d) <b>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</b> We at EstateSync believe that most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at <a href="mailto:help@estatesync.co">help@estatesync.co</a>. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to EstateSync should be sent to the address provided in the Contact Us section at the end of these Terms of Service  ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If EstateSync and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or EstateSync may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by EstateSync or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator during the arbitration proceeding.
              <br/>(e) <b>Arbitration Procedures.</b> Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless EstateSync and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for USD $10,000 or less, EstateSync agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds USD $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
              <br/>(f) <b>Confidentiality.</b> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
              <br/>(g) <b>Severability.</b> If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the subsection above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
              <br/>(h) <b>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.</b> Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. You also agree that: (i) our Services shall be deemed solely based in the State of Delaware; and (ii) our Services shall be deemed passive Services that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us and our assigns, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware.

              <br/>(a) EstateSync is committed to cooperating with law enforcement while respecting each individual’s right to privacy. If EstateSync receives a request for user account information from a government agency investigating criminal activity, we will review the request to be certain that it satisfies all legal requirements before releasing information to the requesting agency.
              <br/>(b) Furthermore, under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4) (Voluntary Disclosure Of Customer Communications or Records), EstateSync may disclose user account information to law enforcement, without a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, in response to a valid emergency when we believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to someone. EstateSync will not release more information than it prudently believes is necessary to prevent harm in an emergency situation.
