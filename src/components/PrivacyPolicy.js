              <strong>‍‍‍‍International Privacy Practices</strong><br/>
              ‍In order to provide our products and services to you, we may send and store your personal information outside of the country where you reside or are located, including in the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including countries that may not, or do not, provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the European Union ("EU") or European Economic Area ("EEA") and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EU and EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. By accessing and using the EstateSync Website or our Services, users who reside, or are located, in countries outside of the United States, agree and consent to the transfer to, and processing of, personal information on servers located outside of the country where they reside and assume the risk that the protection of such information may be different, and may be less protective, than those required under the laws of their residence or location.

              <strong>‍‍‍‍Do Not Track Settings</strong><br/>
              ‍Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting Cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept Cookies. There currently is no accepted standard for how to respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.

              ‍‍(a) EstateSync is committed to cooperating with law enforcement while respecting each individual’s right to privacy. If EstateSync receives a request for user account information from a government agency investigating criminal activity, we will review the request to be certain that it satisfies all legal requirements before releasing information to the requesting agency.<br/>
              (b) Furthermore, under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4) (Voluntary Disclosure Of Customer Communications or Records), EstateSync may disclose user account information to law enforcement,  without a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, in response to a valid emergency when we believe that doing so is necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to someone. EstateSync will not release more information than it prudently believes is necessary to prevent harm in an emergency situation.
